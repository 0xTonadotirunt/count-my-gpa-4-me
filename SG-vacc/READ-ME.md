SINGAPORE VACCINATION BY AGE GROUP ( FIRST DOSE AND FULLY VACCINATED ) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observation 1: visualisation show that older generations were given priority for the vaccine (age 60+)
with age group 60-69 leading the pack.

Observation 2: The take up of vaccine for ages 80+ were slow. This could be likely due to health complications

Observation 3: the speed of taking up vaccine(first dose and full vacc)for ages group 60-69 were the fastest, 
which could possibly imply people there was high demand of vaccine from that age group
